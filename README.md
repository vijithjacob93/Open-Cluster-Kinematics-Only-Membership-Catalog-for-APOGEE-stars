# Open-Cluster-Kinematics-Only-Membership-Catalog-for-APOGEE-stars
We present a membership catalog for open clusters in APOGEE DR16, with stars selected solely on the basis of radial velocities (from APOGEE) and proper motions (fromg Gaia). This catalog is useful for work on clsuter chemisty since we do not use chemical information in our membership selection.
