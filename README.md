# Open-Cluster-Kinematic-Membership-Catalog-for-APOGEE-stars
I present a membership catalog for open clusters in APOGEE DR16, with stars selected solely on the basis of radial velocities (from APOGEE) and proper motions (from Gaia). The membership method is outlined in detail in the following publication (Poovelil et al., 2020):

Please cite this paper if you use data from this repository. This catalog is particularly useful for work on cluster chemisty since we do not use chemical information in our membership selection. 

## clusters.txt
This file contains information about the clusters for which we obtain membership information, including age, metallicity, distance, radial velocities, and proper motions.

## members.txt
This file contains the APOGEE IDs and membership probabilities of all the stellar members we obtain using our kinematic membership selection.
